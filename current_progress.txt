todo: implement advanced aur dependency mgmt
- issue:  due to the nature for the PKGBUILD file and how depenendecies can be listed,
          a simple sed/grep text parsing won't work, e.g ('dep1' 'dep2'), (dep1 dep2)
          (dep1>1.1.0 dep2) and so on: they might have ' or " or nothing, might have
          > or < version specifiers...
          
- fix?:   implement python string formatter




done: README changed for this feature
